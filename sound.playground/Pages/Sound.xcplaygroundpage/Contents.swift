 Hello, this is Sound! A swift playground game that helps the musical learning using the Kodály method.
 The Kodály method relates some hand signs (called solfège syllables) to the seven music notes.
 This signs were reproduced by the children while they sing usually folcloric songs.
 The solfège syllables were made to be simple to reproduce, they were designed to children
 musical education, but it's hard to memorize they all.
 
 And here is Sound!
 
 In the home screen you can play with the music notes (try pressing them), and when you feel comfortable with
 it you can start playing.
 
 When the game begins it will run some notes automatically, and when it stops you will need to guess
 what musical note is related to that solfège.
 
 **Tip_1:** When guessing the note, tap in the solfège to listen to the note again.
 **Tip_2:** It's easier to memorize the notes if you reproduce the solfège.
 **Tip_3:** It's funnier to play if you try to sing along with the lyrics.
 
 Well, that's all!
 Have fun!
